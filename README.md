# MCP Multiagent Bridge

Production-ready Python MCP server for secure multi-agent coordination with comprehensive safeguards.

## Overview

Enables multiple LLM agents (Claude, Codex, GPT, etc.) to collaborate safely through the Model Context Protocol without sharing workspaces or credentials. Built with security-first architecture and production-grade safeguards.

**Use cases:**
- Backend agent coordinating with frontend agent on different codebases
- Security review agent validating changes from development agent
- Specialized agents collaborating on complex multi-step workflows
- Any scenario requiring isolated agents to communicate securely

---

## Key Features

### üîí Security Architecture

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- HMAC-SHA256 session token authentication
- Automatic secret redaction (API keys, passwords, tokens, private keys)
- 3-hour session expiration with automatic cleanup
- SQLite WAL mode for atomic, race-condition-free operations

**4-Stage YOLO Guard‚Ñ¢:**
Command execution (optional) requires multiple confirmation layers:
1. Environment gate - explicit `YOLO_MODE=1` opt-in
2. Interactive typed confirmation phrase
3. One-time validation code (prevents automation)
4. Time-limited approval tokens (5-minute TTL, single-use)

**Rate Limiting:**
- Token bucket algorithm with configurable windows
- Default: 10 requests/minute, 100/hour, 500/day
- Per-session tracking with automatic reset
- Prevents abuse while allowing legitimate bursts

**Audit Trail:**
- Comprehensive JSONL logging of all operations
- Timestamps, session IDs, actions, results
- Tamper-evident sequential logging
- Supports compliance and forensic analysis

### üèóÔ∏è Production-Ready Architecture

- **Message-only bridge** - No auto-execution, returns proposals only
- **Schema validation** - Strict JSON schemas for all MCP tools
- **Command validation** - Configurable whitelist/blacklist patterns
- **Comprehensive error handling** - Graceful degradation, informative errors
- **Extensible design** - Plugin architecture for future backends

### üì¶ Platform Support

**Works with any MCP-compatible LLM:**
- Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Claude API
- OpenAI models (via MCP adapters)
- Anthropic API models
- Custom/future models (not tied to specific backend)
